OVERVIEW OF WEBSITE:
The goal is to create a simple text based browser game in the style of "choose your own adventure".


The main webpage will consist of a main menu that contains a start button, help button, and implement a save/load feature that can be accessed from the main menu.


The start button will change the page to the main game.
the help page will give a short description on how the game operates, and a short overview of the game.


The main game will have  5 parts:


Story
Setting
Player actions
Player inventory
Top Navbar


The story box has a large block of text in the center of the screen describing the current scene the player is in, which can alter the text depending on what player action is chosen in the player actions block.


The setting is a box on the upper right hand corner with a image that adequately shows the environment the player is currently in.


The player actions box is a small rectangular box in the bottom of the page having a few actions or responses the player can click on for that particular scene.


The player inventory is a box in the middle to lower right that lists the various items and gear the player currently has, which can affect the actions available to the player.


The top navbar will have a return button (to return to main menu), as well as a save button to save a players current progress.


OVERVIEW OF DATA STORAGE:
The back end data will store save files.
