Inn:

Its been a hard month for you, Sir Knight. The peasants are happy and hard working, the bandits have been laying low, and there is no crusade to fight for. You spend your last few coins on a pint of ale and give the innkeeper a sad nod of the head.

With a crash the innkeeper doors burst open.
